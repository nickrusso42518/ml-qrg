    "This unsupervised machine learning algorithm is not directly related to neural networks. However, it is commonly used to visualize the input data $X$. When $X$ has many features, PCA can compress the data to reduce the number of features. Visualizing highly dimensional data in 2 or 3 dimensions helps engineers surface correlations and patterns. PCA's ability to reduce dimensionality also reduces the computing time and power required to train a neural network.\n",

    "In practice, PCA is more commonly used for visualization/exploration. It is less commonly used to speed up training as this reduction does cause some loss of granularity/variance, leading to worse predictions. Given the computing resources available in modern times, compressing the input data is less important than it was in years past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some practitioners have suggested using PCA to reduce dimensionality when one-hot encoding (OHE) is in use. For example, applying OHE to a classification with 4 choices only yields 4 features. Apply the same logic to a country code may yield 200 features. This explosion of data may not have much predictive relevance for the model; reducing it with PCA might be worthwhile."

This helps emphasize the diagonal decision boundary separating \"men\" from \"not men\". It is also not common to annotate individual points with their example number. Doing so here helps further reinforce the visualization of the clusters.\n",

    "By definition, PC1 accounts for a greater share of the variance than PC2. The difference between the leftmost (15) and rightmost (6) values is about 160 along the PC1 axis. The difference between the topmost (19) and bottommost (8) is about 22 along the PC2 axis. If we completely ignored PC2 and only projected all the points onto a number line representing PC1, we still have a pretty good idea of how the data separates. However, adding the second dimension with the PC2 axis gives us a clearer picture. It also helps to draw a better decision boundary."

    "#### Simplified Supervised Training\n",
    "The `transform()` function performs dimensionality reduction after the PCs have been discovered by the `fit()` function. The code below compares a logistic regression model trained on all features of $X$, versus another logistic regression model trained on the PCA-reduced dimensions of $X$. Because the PCs represent more than 99% of the variance, we expect both models to perform about the same, with the PCA-trained model performing slightly worse. Whenever you compress data using PCA, you forfeit a bit of granularity for a significant decrease in dimensionality (at least in theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 example queries shown below. The first 2 are \"men\" and the second 2 are \"not men\". When making predictions with a PCA-trained model, one must transform the input query (containing all 5 features) into a PCA-compatible query containing only 2 features represented by PCs. Behind the scenes, PCA applies Z-score normalization (standardization) to the data; this is also required at prediction time, hence the call to `transform()`. In this simple test, both models get all 4 predictions correct."

Due to PCA's linear nature, it is not effective at measuring non-linear relationships between features. Consider scaling your data using exponential (logarithmic curve to line) or logarithmic (exponential curve to line) transforms to make it linear before running PCA. "

For all methods, be sure to apply normalization when making predictions using the same computed values (such as $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and various minimums/maximums) to the new input. Normalization is not applied to categorical features of $X$ or labels of $\\hat{Y}$.\n",

This is most commonly used for general features, although may perform poorly with some extreme outliers. The mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. Positive numbers represent values above the mean while negative numbers represent values below the mean. It is also called \"standardization\" or \"the standard scaler\".\n",

    "#### Batch\n",
    "Just as with $X$, layered outputs within a neural network can be normalized. It is possible to apply this normalization to the linear output $Z^{[l]}$ or the activation output $A^{[l]}$, although it is more commonly applied to $Z^{[l]}$. You could replace all instances of $Z^{[l]}$ with $A^{[l]}$ in these equations to batch normalize the results after activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every feature $_j$ of $Z^{[l]}$ (which corresponds to a unit in that layer), compute the mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mu & = \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^m Z^{[l]}_j \\\\\n",
    "\\sigma^2 & = \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^m (Z^{[l]}_j - \\mu)^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, normalize $Z^{[l]}_j$ to yield $Z^{[l]norm}_j$ which has a mean of 0 in a variance of 1 for each feature. The presence of $\\varepsilon$ is for numeric stability and has an infinitesimal impact on the mean and variance just described. Two additional per-layer parameters, $\\gamma^{[l]}$ and $\\beta^{[l]}$, are introduced to further transform the result. To retain a mean of zero, in a variance of one, use $\\gamma^{[l]}=1$ and $\\beta^{[l]}=0$. To nullify the batch normalization process entirely, use $\\gamma^{[l]}=\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\varepsilon}$ and $\\beta^{[l]}=\\mu$. Like the weights $W^{[l]}$ and biases $b^{[l]}$, $\\gamma^{[l]}$ and $\\beta^{[l]}$ are learnable. Finally, all of $\\tilde{Z}^{[l]}$ becomes an input to the activation function $g()$ and the process continues as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Z^{[l]norm}_j & = \\frac{Z^{[l]}_j - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\varepsilon}} \\\\\n",
    "\\tilde{Z}^{[l]}_j & = (\\gamma^{[l]} \\cdot Z^{[l]norm}_j) + \\beta^{[l]} \\\\\n",
    "A^{[l+1]} & = g(\\tilde{Z}^{[l]})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that bias $b^{[l]}$ becomes irrelevant with batch normalization because the mean $\\mu$ is set to 0. Instead, $\\beta^{[l]}$ serves as the per-unit offset. You can either set all biases to 0 or remove it from your algorithm entirely. Like the bias matrix $b^{[l]}$, both $\\gamma^{[l]}$ and $\\beta^{[l]}$ are applied unit-wise and thus have a shape of $(n_l, 1)$. Additionally, batch normalization has a slight regularizing effect when combined with mini-batch gradient descent. Due to the scaling by the mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ of a mini-batch (which doesn't represent all of $X$), the precise activation values become noisier. The smaller the mini-batch size, the greater the regularization effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions when mini-batches are use, we must estimate $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ since the values computed for a single mini-batch cannot be used at test time. Instead, use an EWMA across the $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ values for each mini-batch. These are non-learnable parameters of the algorithm."

    "#### Overview\n",
    "Proper initialization of weights is necessary to prevent exploding and vanishing gradient problems in deep neural networks (those with many layers). Derivatives used during back propagation can become too large (exploding), which causes divergence, if the weights are initialized too large. They can also become too small (vanishing), which causes an inability to converge, if the weights are initialized too small. Initializing the weights with values slightly less than 1 and slightly greater than 1 mitigates the problem, although does not completely solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, weight initialization avoids the \"symmetry\" problem whereby by every units learns the same thing, reducing the entire neural network to a single unit. Such a model is only as powerful as linear or logistic regression in isolation. Note that you can also initialize biases the same way. It is common to initialize biases to zero as this will not inhibit a model's ability to learn.\n",

    "#### Overview\n",
    "This section describes the criteria for identifying underfitting and overfitting models. Definitions:\n",
    "  1. $J_{bayes}$: theoretically lowest possible cost (Bayes error)\n",
    "  2. $J_{human}$: human baseline performance\n",
    "  3. $J_{train}$: total cost of training set $X_{train}$\n",
    "  4. $J_{cv}$: total cost of cross validation (aka development or dev) set $X_{cv}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of $X$ should be shuffled between these three sets, especially if they come from different distributions. This may include different sources (real vs. synthetic, official database vs. social media, etc), different geographical regions, or any other differentiating factor. This is especially important with respect to the cross validation and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of a model is based on two types of metrics:\n",
    "  1. __Optimizing__: the single metric that should be improved to the greatest degree. For example, maximizing accuracy or minimizing false positives.\n",
    "  2. __Satisficing__: the remaining metrics that must be satisfied, but not necessarily optimized. For example, ensuring that predictions take less than 10 seconds or ensuring that the model fits into 200 megabytes of memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these metrics, use the __evaluation criteria__ to intelligently combine them. First, find all models that meet the satisficing metrics. Of those models, select the one with the best optimizing metric. Suppose that accuracy is the optimizing metric while prediction time and memory consumption are satisficing metrics. Following this process, model D is superior in the example table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "|                | Accuracy % | Pred time (s) | Mem con (MB) | Analysis           |\n",
    "| -------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |\n",
    "| Eval criteria  | $\\ge$ 95   | $\\le$ 10      | $\\le$ 200    |                    |\n",
    "| Model A        | 100        | 5             | 1500         | mem con too high   |\n",
    "| Model B        | 99         | 30            | 75           | pred time too high |\n",
    "| Model C        | 93         | 5             | 150          | accuracy too low   |\n",
    "| Model D        | 97         | 9             | 190          | best option        |\n",
    "\n",
    "To most rapidly improve accuracy, identify the biggest contributor to the error. For example, if 30% of incorrect predictions are due to blurry images, but only 10% are due to upside down images, you should focus on tuning the model to tolerate blurry images first. This isn't rigorously proven, but it provides a general direction for taking the first remedial steps. Make small changes in the chosen direction (e.g. improving burry image performance), see if it helps, then continue to iterate.\n",

However, once the model's performance reaches this point, progress becomes much slower. Determining what to change is difficult because there is no obvious baseline against which to compare.\n",

    "#### Transfer Learning\n",
    "This technique involves first training a model for a generic purpose, such as image recognition, speech transcription, or text generation. Later, perhaps someone introduces a more specific use case for each of these categories, such radiology (image), translation to a specific language (speech), or composing Python code (text). One can \"transfer\" all of the existing layers, excluding the output layer, to a new model. Technically, it transfers the trained parameters, which required time and computing power to learn. In this way, the new model leverages all of the effort already invested. This process is called __pre-training__ and the addition of one or more layers to the end of the model is called __fine-tuning__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the pre-trained model may be effective in its own right, but a finely-tuned model is specialized for a single use case. Such a model can be trained with a relatively small data set. For example, there are many images on the Internet. The total number of radiological images is far fewer, allowing the radiology use case to consume the generic image recognition techniques within the pre-trained layers of the model. In addition to reducing the training time and the burden of collecting training data, transfer learning also enables entirely new use cases that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last layers of a neural network are considered at the \"top\" in some frameworks, which are typically retrained, if not entirely replaced or augmented. In general, the less training data available for fine-tuning, the more topmost layers should be retrained. If you have a sizable amount of data for fine-tuning, you may want to retrain a handful of the topmost layers (say, the topmost 5 layers). The pre-trained parameters can serve as good initial values for those final layers. This retraining technique is effective because it enables the high-level features to be retrained (such as facial expressions) while retaining the low-level (such as lines, corners, and curves) seen earlier in the model's architecture. Note that transfer learning is still useful even if you have an enormous training set. You can start from a known-good model, using the trained parameters as initial values, then retraining everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an implementation detail, layers that are untrainable effectively turn into a static function that gives a consistent results for any given input. After all, their weights, biases, activations, and hyperparameters never change. Sometimes it can be effective to process all of training examples through the untrainable layers of the model and write those activations at the disk. Suppose that the model has 22 layers with the first 20 being untrainable. The activations of layer 20 $(A^{[20]})$ are stored on disk and serve as inputs to layer 21, the first trainable layer. This can further reduce the computing power required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the prediction matrix shape $\\hat{Y}$ of the model may also change. For example, consider a generic model with a single sigmoid-activated unit in the output layer (mimicking logistic regression) that determines whether a patient has any kind of cancer $y=1$ or not $y=0$ given a tumor image. This model could be finely-tuned into a softmax regression layer that offers probabilities on the 5 different stages of lung cancer given a tumor image."

    "#### Multi-task Learning\n",
    "In contrast to single task learning, multi-task learning creates a single model to solve multiple problems at the same time. For example, if you are developing an image recognition model to determine if the image contains cars, people, and buildings, the shape of the prediction matrix $\\hat{Y}$ would be $(3,m)$ where $m$ the number of training examples. Each row of this matrix represents the yes $y=1$ or no $y=0$ answer to the 3 aforementioned questions, effectively combining 3 otherwise separate binary classification problems. Note that this is unlike softmax regression as these 3 results are not dependent upon one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to create 3 separate single-task models, each yielding a prediction matrix $\\hat{Y}$ of shape $(1,m)$ to classify the 3 attributes independently. This is a reasonable solution and has the benefit of decoupling the problem set. However, the models would need to be independently trained, despite having nearly identical images as inputs, which requires more time and/or computing power."

    "#### Dropout\n",
    "Randomly deactivate certain units in a neural network layer for a given iteration of gradient descent. This makes layers more sparse and the remaining units are trained normally. When applied, the model cannot rely heavily on a single feature as the weight values are spread out. Dropout is commonly used in computer vision as there is rarely enough data, making overfitting common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most implementations define a `keep_prob` input, identifying the probability that any given unit remains in service. Other implementations define a `drop_prob` input, identifying the probability that any given unit is dropped from service. Focusing on the `keep_prob` logic, the range is $\\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}\\,|\\,0 \\lt p \\le 1\\}$. Setting `keep_prob = 1` disables dropout. It is specified on a per-layer basis, and it typically limited to hidden layers. Applying dropout to the input layer means discarding entire features. Applying dropout to the output layer means discarding categorical classes in a softmax regression, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also common to divide the resulting activation matrix $A$ by the `keep_prob` so that the activation values more closely resemble results from the \"full\" layer. This specific implementation is known as \"inverted dropout\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the neural network is different at each iteration of gradient descent, there is no well-defined cost function. Thus, the training and cost cannot be plotted to ensure it continuously decreases. To troubleshoot a model using dropout, set `keep_prob = 1` to temporarily disable dropout, ensure the cost function decreases at each iteration, then re-enable it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some implementations reverse the logic by specifying a `dropout_prob` value in the range $\\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}\\,|\\,0 \\le p \\lt 1\\}$. This determines the probability that a unit is dropped rather than the probability that a unit is kept. The concept is otherwise identical."

    "#### Other Techniques\n",
    "Overfitting can sometimes be solved by supplying additional training examples. Sometimes, sufficient data simply does not exist. Instead, you can create additional examples that are realistic representations of real data. Using the computer vision example, you can flip a picture horizontally or vertically, or perform slight rotations, to create variants of an existing image. Other distortions, such as crops, stretches, and minor color shifts can also help. One particular use of color shifting is to simulate different lighting environments. For example, \"cooler\" light tends to be more blue while warmer light tends to be more yellow. Adjust the RGB values accordingly when creating new images to reflect (no pun intended) these different lighting styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of these techniques are universally valid. For example, if you are training a model to recognize human faces, you would not flip images vertically as it would yield upside down faces. Perhaps this is useful in some scenarios, but likely not most; context matters. Synthesizing training examples is not mutually exclusive with the aforementioned regularization methods. As an added bonus, data augmentation can also help with transfer learning (described elsewhere in this document).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also stop the gradient descent process early, preferably when the difference between the cross-validation error and training error is minimized. This is depicted as \"good fit\" in the conceptual plot. First, train the model and plot both the training and cross-validation error curves. Then, find the required minimum and stop the process after the correct number of iterations. The drawback of this solution is that it is tightly couples the training and regularization processes. It limits future options because if you want to modify the training process, you may also inadvertently impact the regularization process. Many experts prefer to use a dedicated regularization method to separate these two efforts (ie, to keep them orthogonal)."

    "Update the weights $W$ and biases $b$ at a given layer $[l]$ after a full pass of the training set. It subtracts the product of the learning rate $\\alpha$ and derivative with respect to the parameters in question $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial W^{[l]}}$ or $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial b^{[l]}}$. The derivative determines the parameters's contribution to the total cost $J$. If the parameter was a major contributor to the total cost, the derivative will be a large positive or negative number. Negative derivatives will result in a positive change to the value, bringing it closer to 0. Positive derivatives achieve the same goal in the opposite direction, reducing the value to bring it closer to 0.\n",

Given a highly dimensional plot with many parameters, such local minima are rare as all dimensions would need to be convex (sloping upwards) at once.

    "When the number of training examples $m$ is large, batch gradient descent cannot act until all training examples have been processed. Minibatches break up this process, allowing gradient descent to act sooner, albeit without seeing the entire training set. This makes the weight and bias adjustments less precise but faster and more frequent.\n",

    "Be sure to shuffle the training data and the corresponding labels before dividing into mini-batches. Use a common random seed to ensure $X$ and $Y$ are shuffled according to the same scheme. It is common to create mini-batches sized by powers of 2, such as 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. The sizes are chosen so that they can fit inside of GPUs memory, which vary. Each mini-batch matrix is notated as $X^{\\{t\\}}$ where $t$ is the mini-batch number. Given a mini-batch size of $N$ examples, the shape of $X^{\\{t\\}}$ is $(n_0, N)$. The final mini-batch is likely to be smaller than the mini-batch size to collect all the remaining examples, but this is an implementation detail."

    "This is conceptually identical to mini-batch gradient descent, except the number of training examples in each mini-batch $N$ is only 1. This allows the model to run gradient descent very quickly given that only one training example is being processed, although the cost may not monotonically decrease. That is to say, the cost may occasionally increase, although it is expected to trend downward towards. The drawback of SGD is that it requires $m$ iterations, one per training example, which could number in the millions. This can be computationally expensive as it reduces the efficiency benefits of a fully vectorized implementation."

Rather than uniformly sample across this range, it's more effective to collect a roughly equal number of samples across the different orders of magnitude. "

    "#### Overview\n",
    "This layer forms the basis of a CNN. Primarily used for computer vision use-cases, CONV layers examine subsets of an image at a time, and reducing that subset to a single value. Different filters are used to examine different subsets and are used to detect different features by panning across the image using a stride interval. The total number of parameters is greatly reduced when compared to MLP layers, requiring less time and compute power to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers are effective because the feature-detecting filters are likely to be useful across different parts of the image, which reduces the number of parameters to be trained. Additionally, there are far fewer connections between convolutional layers compared to fully-connected layers. Each convolutional output is depends only on a few inputs (those in the filter's window).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because 2D images are so pervasive, they dominate the discussion of CNNs. However, the concepts can also apply to 1D data (such as EKG streams) and 3D data (such as CT/MRI scans)."

    "#### Computing dJ/dZ, dJ/dA, dJ/dW, and dJ/db\n",
    "Computing $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial Z^{[l]}}$ is the same as an MLP as it requires an element-wise (Hadamard) product between the activation value gradients $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial A^{[l]}}$ and the derivative of the activation function $g^{[l]'}(Z^{[l]})$. Unlike MLP, computing $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial A^{[l-1]}}$ is not necessary to determine the weight derivatives at layer $l$ but is necessary for backwards propagation calculations at the previous layer. It consists of multiplying a given filter $W_c$ by individual scalar values within $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial Z^{[l]}}$, which is the exact same operation as forward propagation in a transverse convolutional layer.

    "In a convolutional layer, multiple filters (feature selectors) can be applied. Each one is represented as a channel in the output matrix $Z^{[l]}$. Those filters always have the same depth as the input matrix $Z^{[l-1]}$. In contrast, pooling filters are always 2D matrices. They are applied individually to each channel of the input matrix $Z^{[l-1]}$, resulting in an output matrix $Z^{[l]}$ that has the same number of channels. As it relates to the output matrix $Z^{[l-1]}$, \"network in network\" filters of shape $(1,1,n_C^{[l-1]})$ can only shrink the number of channels $n_C^{[l]}$ while pooling can only shrink the height $n_H^{[l]}$ and width $n_H^{[l]}$. The techniques can powerfully combine to reform matrices within the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers seldom use padding ($p^{[l]}=0$), although Inception networks are an exception, which is discussed later. This reduces the convolutional dimension equations to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "n_H^{[l]} & = \\Bigl\\lfloor \\frac{n_H^{[l-1]} - f^{[l]}}{s^{[l]}} \\Bigr\\rfloor + 1 \\\\\n",

    "n_C^{[l]} & = n_C^{[l-1]}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, pooling does not have any trainable parameters. It has hyperparameters for the filter size $f^{[l]}$, stride $s^{[l]}$, and type of pooling. The two most commonly pooling types are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  __max__: \"Max pooling\" examines all input matrix $A^{[l-1]}$ cells within the filter's window. It then assigns the maximum value to the proper position in the output matrix $Z^{[l]}_{m,n}$. This technique tends to highlight key aspects with a given window while discarding less important aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  __average__: \"Average pooling\" examines all input matrix $A^{[l-1]}$ cells within the filter's window. It then assigns the mean (average) value to the proper position in the output matrix $Z^{[l]}_{m,n}$. This technique tends to equally summarize all of the cells within the filter's window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are no trainable parameters for pooling layers, they are often considered \"part\" of the previous convolutional layers in literature. This document treats pooling as a separate layer to be consistent with a notation used for documenting MLP. Pooling layers also have their own formulas for backward propagation. This is only for the benefit of previous layers given the lack of trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below demonstrates pooling using an input matrix similar to the previous example. Some shades of gray have been changed to differentiate between the types of pooling. Also, the stride is set to the filter size to eliminate any overlap of cell processing. This technique is not required, but is demonstrated for technical variety. Given an input matrix $X=Z^{[0]}$ of shape $(6,6)$, a pooling filter $f^{[l]}$ of shape $(2,2)$, and a stride $s^{[l]}$ of 2, the resulting matrix $Z^{[1]}$ will have shape $(3,3)$."

The next 4 values determine the rectangle's shape. $b_x$ and $b_y$ represent the position at the center of the box relative to the image sized, scaled to values between 0 and 1. $b_h$ and $b_w$ measure the ratio of the bounding box compared to image size.

For example, the first landmark $l_1$ must always be above the left eye, while the second landmark $l_2$ must always be above the right eye. Now, the length of each $y^{(m)}$ column vector becomes a function of both of the number of classes $k$ and the number of two-value landmarks $2l$.

    "#### Sliding Window\n",
    "This algorithm uses a filter (the sliding window) that pan an image, similar to the motion of a convolutional filter.  In order to determine whether the object under the sliding window matches the object of interest, you typically train a CNN using closely-cropped images, containing those objects of interest. That CNN will make predictions for each sub-image under the sliding window. If the desired object is seen within that filter, the algorithm returns 1, otherwise it returns 0. This process repeats with different values of $f$ to control filter size and $s$ to control stride size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is computationally expensive given that the CNN must make many predictions for every sub-image under many variable-sized sliding windows. One optimization is to replace the fully-connected layers with convolutional layers. To do that, set the number of filters is equal to the number of units previously contained in the fully-connected layer ($n_C^{[l]}$). Also, set the height and width of the filters equal to the dimensions of the previous layer's outputs $(f_H^{[l]} = n_H^{[l-1]}, f_W^{[l]} = n_W^{[l-1]})$. This yields an output of shape $(1,1,n_C^{[l]})$, which closely resembles the shape of the fully-connected layer. This is more computationally efficient as it shares computations better when sliding window regions overlap. Said another way, the filter doesn't iteratively \"pan and compute\" in isolation using a convolutional layer."

    "#### You Only Look Once (YOLO)\n",
    "This algorithm breaks an image into a grid, make it easier to identify precise bounding boxes for objects of interest detected. Objects within the image are assigned to a single cell within the grid. The upper left corner of the image is considered the origin at position $(0,0)$ in the lower right is position $(1,1)$. This way, all positional values are between 0 and 1. Supposing there are 3 possible classes of interesting objects, the training labels for a grid cell will have 8 elements to account for the probability of any object of interest being present in the grid cell ($P_c$), the bounding box location measurements $(b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w)$, and the probabilities of each class $(P_{c1}, P_{c2}, P_{c3})$. These per-class probabilities are typically one-hot encoded for training, better aligning to the softmax-like probabilities generated for each class during prediction. This process operates on a per grid cell basis, so supposing the grid was $10 \\times 10$, each input image would be represented by 100 vectors of length 8. The output volume's shape from the algorithm would therefore be $(10,10,8)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the accuracy of a bounding box prediction is to use the __Intersection over Union (IoU)__ method. This computes the area of the bounding boxes supplied by $Y$ and $\\hat{Y}$ for a given training example. Next, it divides the intersection of the areas by the union of the areas, then compares the quotient to a threshold. If the ratio is greater than 0.5, it is commonly considered a good prediction. Since this is a human-chosen threshold, raising it will lead to more accurate bounding box predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a finely-grained grid, many adjacent cells may claim to see an object of interest ($P_c \\ge 0.5$), even if they only see a part of it. YOLO requires the object to be assigned to only one cell even if the bounding box spans multiple cells. __Non-max suppression__ compares all of the $P_c$ values and summarily discards those less than a threshold, say 0.6 for example. These cells don't contain any part of the object and don't require further evaluation. Then, the algorithm finds the cell with the highest $P_c$ value and discards adjacent abounding boxes with a high IoU (say, 0.5) with respect to the best bounding box. The algorithm runs independently for each class to get the final prediction. As described by the name, this enhancement suppresses any boxes that are not \"maximal\", leading to a single answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there are multiple objects of different classes within the same grid cell. YOLO can use __anchor boxes__ to classify these objects independently. Each anchor box is represented by its own set of labels in $Y$. For example, if there are 3 classes, there will be 8 values in the the $y$ column vector associated with a single cell. If 2 separate anchor boxes are adequate to capture these 3 classes, there will be 16 values in $y$, one for each anchor box. Objects are now assigned to a specific anchor box within a specific grid cell. The anchor box to which an object is assigned is based on the highest computed IoU. Given a $10 \\times 10$ grid, the resulting volume has shape $(10,10,16)$. Sometimes this is expressed as a 4 dimensional shape which independently accounts for the number of anchor boxes (2), and the values within each anchor box (8), such as $(10,10,2,8)$. This structure is more explicit but is harder to visualize; this book prefers the consolidated 3D format.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can determine anchor box sizes manually if you have an intuition regarding their dimensions and quantity. Alternatively, you can use the k-means unsupervised learning algorithm to discover clusters of objects, then create the appropriate anchor boxes. Anchor boxes are defined only by their height and width, not their position within a grid cell, unlike a bounding box which has all 4.. Note that if the number of object shapes is greater than the number of anchor boxes, the algorithm performs poorly. Also, if several classes have the same anchor box shape, the algorithm is forced to select only one, also leading to poor performance. In practice, multiple objects appearing in the same cell (assuming a finely-grained grid) is relatively rare.\n",

    "Triplet loss compares the two separate predictions using a mix of new formulas and hyperparameters. It was defined in the Facenet paper by Florian Schroff et al in 2015. You can read the details [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832). \n",

    "3. negative ($x_n$): another image depicting someone who is not the anchor\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Facenet paper uses notation $x^a_i$ to indicate the anchor image $a$ of a triplet for the $i$-th training example. This section adjusts that notation to $x^{(i)}_a$ for consistency with the rest of the document. The same is true for $p$ and $n$ images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, the goal is to measure the difference between the anchor and positive, then between the anchor and negative. The first quantity ($a-p$) should be small while the second quantity ($a-n$) should be large. In the context of triplet loss, $\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter called \"margin\". Without $\\alpha$ (or setting it to 0), the algorithm can just set both quantities to 0 for a trivial/useless solution. The algorithm works best when the two quantities are approximately equal so that the algorithm has something to adjust.\n",

    "Differences will often be large when comparing two random people. Each mini-batch should contain several positive examples along with \"semi-hard\" (ie, low loss) negative examples. The superlatively hard negatives (two people who look very similar) should be avoided as it can lead to local minima by collapsing all operands to 0. The dataset must contain multiple images of same person (e.g., 5,000 images of 500 people). The total cost $J$ is the sum of the losses $L$ for each $m$ training example, which applies a ReLU-like operation to raise all negative costs to 0. Said another way, when the difference between the anchor/positive and the anchor/negative is less than the margin, face verification succeeded and there is no loss.\n",

    "__LeNet-5__ was created by Yann LeCun et al in 1998 and is documented [here](http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf). The goal of this network is to recognize grayscale handwritten digits of size $(32,32,1)$. At that time, padding and max pooling were not commonly used. The activation functions were sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent (tanh) rather than ReLU. Aside from these implementation differences, LeNet-5 uses several convolutional + average pooling combination layers. The activation function was applied after pooling, which is also uncommon today. The network ends with 2 fully connected layers to make a prediction against 10 classes (1 per digit) in a manner similar to softmax. A non-softmax implementation with 84 units in the final layer was used to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "__AlexNet__ was created by Alex Krizhevsky et al in 2012 and is documented [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf). It was designed for general-purpose image recognition. It relies heavily on \"same\" padding to preserve the image size when performing convolutions, while also using max pooling to reduce the image dimension over time. It also relies on the ReLU activation. The general architecture is similar to LeNet-5 as the convolutional/pooling blocks are placed first, followed by some fully-connected layers. The final layer uses a 1000-class softmax activation to classify the images. In terms of total parameters, it was roughly 1,000 times larger than LeNet-5 (60k versus 60M).\n",

    "__VGG-16__ (Visual Geometry Group) was created by Karen Simonyan et al in 2015 and is documented [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556). Although AlexNet worked well for large-scale computer image recognition, VGG-16 proposed a simpler architecture by always using same-padded convolutions combined with uniformly-sized max pooling operations. Specifically, it used convolutional layers with filters of size 3 and stride of 1, plus max pooling of size 2 and stride of 2. This is significantly reduces the number of hyperparameters as they do not vary by layer. Broadly speaking, the pooling operations decrease the height and width by half while the convolutional operations increasing the depth by doubling the number of filters applied. The network is more than twice the size of AlexNet with 138M parameters. Another popular version is VGG-19 which has 19 layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For their time, these classic architectures were very effective and helped reveal a common pattern in CNN design. As images progress through the network, their heights $n_H$ and widths $n_W$ tend to decrease due to convolutional and pooling layers. Concurrently, their depths $n_C$ tend to increase as more and more filters are applied. Because those filters carry trainable weights, they are unrolled at the end of the convolutional/pooling sequence and fed into fully-connected layers to make a prediction."

    "To discover that ratio, each of the 3 variables is scaled by a constant coefficient described below. All coefficients are real numbers greater than or equal to 1 ($n \\in \\mathbb{R}| \\ge 1$). The algorithm then fixes the coefficient exponent $\\phi$ to 1 and performs a grid search to find values of the coefficient to satisfy the constraint. Example values for these coefficients might be $\\alpha=1.2$, $\\beta=1.12$, and $\\gamma=1.15$. \n",

    "#### U-Net\n",
    "Rather than draw coarse bounding boxes around detected objects (as seen with YOLO), U-Net classifies individual pixels as being part of a certain class. This is called __semantic segmentation__ and provides precise object detection for its intended use case of medical imaging. This network is so named because it resembles the letter \"U\" when drawn with the left downward sloping curve resembling encoding/contraction and the right upward sloping curve resembling decoding/expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical CNNs will decrease the volume's height and width while increasing the number of channels. A fully convolutional network (FCN) uses transpose convolutional layers (described earlier) instead of fully-connected layers to expand the volume to its original height and width $(n_H^{[0]}$ and $n_W^{[0]})$. U-Net builds on the FCN concept by using an equal number of contracting (downsampling) and expansion (upsampling) layers to accomplish this. It also adds residual \"skip\" connections between corresponding layers when the volume shapes are the same. Set another way, for every max pooling layer that decrease the height and width, there is an opposite but equal transpose convolutional layer that restores it. These opposing layers are connected with a aforementioned skip connection, reducing data loss from the original input while also reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the contracting layers (aka contracting path) use 2 convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by a max pooling layer. The expanding layers (aka expanding path) use 2 convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by a transpose convolutional layer. None of the aforementioned convolutional layers change the height or width as they all use the \"same\" padding. Given an RBG input image of shape $(n_H^{[0]}, n_W^{[0]}, 3)$, U-Net outputs a prediction of shape $(n_H^{[0]}, n_W^{[0]}, n_C^{[L]})$ where the output channels $n_C^{[L]}$ equals the number of possible classes. U-Net uses the sparse categorical cross entropy loss function, similar to softmax, to predict the probabilities for each class."

    "There are 3 types of RNN with respect to input and output sizes:\n",
    "  1. __Many to many__: Given many time series inputs from $x$, there are many predictions (outputs) $\\hat{y}$, one at each time step. Sometimes the number of inputs and outputs are equal, such as in Named Entity Recognition (NER). For example, \"Nick slept for one hour\" -> \"NICK slept for ONE hour\". Sometimes the input and output lengths are unequal, such as in language translation, whereby the encoder consumes the inputs and the decoder makes predictions. For example, \"what would you like to eat?\" -> \"你想吃什么？\".\n",
    "  2. __Many to one__: Given many time series inputs from $x$, there is a single prediction (output) $\\hat{y}$ at the end, just one output at the end. An example might be sentiment analysis, mapping \"this ice cream tastes awful\" to 1-star and \"it's the best ice cream ever\" to 5-star.\n",
    "  3. __One to many__: Given a single input $x$, there are many predictions (outputs) $\\hat{y}$, one at each time step. This can be used for music generation, which is a sequence of notes, given only a genre as input. The input could be larger, like an image, while the output can be a text caption. This is also called a __sequence model__ and uses the previous time-step's prediction as input to the current step given that there is only one $x$ input to start the process. Sometimes $x$ can even be all zeros, allowing the sequence model to predict whatever it wants (based on how it was trained)."

    "Embeddings allow us to predict new words based on relationships between other words. The code below answers the question: __\"Puppy is to dog as kitten is to what?\"__ The answer is __\"cat\"__, and the vector values are printed to the terminal and plotted using PCA. Because the embedding matrix has more than 2 features, 2D visualization techniques (like PCA and others) are useful for learning/testing."

    "#### Learning with Neural Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique was created by Yoshua Bengio et al in 2003 and is documented [here](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf). The goal is to learn text embeddings using a relatively simple MLP. First, compute the embedding vectors $e_w$ for a fixed number of words within a sentence. This number of words is a hyperparameter $n$ which influences the number of units in the first MLP layer. Given an embedding dimensionality $D$ and the number of words $n$, the shape of the input matrix $X$ becomes $(D \\times n, m)$ where $m$ is the number of $n$-word training examples. The first layer uses hyperbolic tangent activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and final layer uses a softmax activation, interpreted as an OHE vector selecting the correct next word. As such, it has shape $(V,m)$ where $V$ is the vocabulary size. Both of the MLP layers have traditional weights $W^{[l]}$ and biases $b^{[l]}$ to be trained. Additionally, the embedding matrix $E$ is also trainable."

    "In practice, this algorithm is computational expensive due to the softmax activation given a large vocabulary $V$. An alternative is to use a hierarchical softmax design by determining if the correct word is in the first or last \"half\" of the vocabularly. These \"halves\" are not necessarily equal in size and the word order is not necessarily preserved. More common words tend to be shallower in the tree (closer to the ropt), causing the algorithm to run faster. This reduces the algorithm's time complexity from linear to logarithmic."
